# Equinix Metal Network Automation using Terraform

This IaC configuration deploys two nodes in different Metros and connects them using Equinix Metal's [Hybrid Bonded Mode](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/layer2-networking/hybrid-bonded-mode/). Thus, the nodes enable both public and private networking.
